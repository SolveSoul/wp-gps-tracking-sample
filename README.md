#Windows Phone 8.1 GPS User Location Tracking Sample
This sample shows two ways of tracking the user via the Geolocator class:
* With a DispatcherTimer calling GetGeopositionAsync() every few seconds
* With the GeoLocator StatusChanged event (prefered method)

The sample implements the MVVM pattern, implemented via Galasoft MVVM Light.
